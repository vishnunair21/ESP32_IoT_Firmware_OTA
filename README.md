# ESP32 IoT Device Firmware with OTA

**Description:**
ESP32 firmware project implementing OTA updates with a robust multitasking architecture. 
This project demonstrates building a layered firmware using FreeRTOS tasks for Wi-Fi, MQTT, sensors, OTA updates, and a watchdog timer. 
The OTA implementation uses HTTPS with rollback-safe dual partitions.
